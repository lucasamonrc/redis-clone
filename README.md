# <img src="https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/redis-2/1451/Untitled-2-512.png" alt="Redis icon" width=32 /> Redis Clone

A simplified clone of the popular Redis server implemented in C#. RedisClone is designed to demonstrate the core functionality of a Redis server by supporting basic commands like ECHO, PING, SET, and GET. It provides a basic Redis-like experience for users exploring key-value storage and retrieval over a network.

## üéØ Justification

This problem is for learning purposes only. It serves no real purpose beyond learning more about C# and some underlying systems principles such as multi-threading, and networking programming. This application should not be used in production.

## üíª Project Demo   

Since this is a simplified implementation of the redis server, you can interact with it locally by using the `redis-cli` utility. Make sure the server is running on the default port 6379.
